# Be My Valentine?

A simple interactive Valentine webpage with a playful twist. Users are asked "Will you be my Valentine?" with two buttons: "Yes" and "No". Clicking "Yes" leads to a thank you page, while clicking "No" causes the "No" button to shrink and disappear, encouraging the user to say "Yes".

## How to Use

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to experience the interaction.

## Interaction Details

- **Yes button:** Redirects to `thanks.html` with a thank you message.
- **No button:** Shrinks on each click, eventually disappearing and redirecting to the thank you page.
